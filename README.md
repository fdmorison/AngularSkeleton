# AngularSkeleton

This project works as an initial AngularJS set up for new frontend projects. Also, Twitter Bootstrap is used for layouting and styling while GruntJS is used to build the project. It helps to avoid starting new projects from scratch by acting as a template from which all other projects of the same kind are made.
